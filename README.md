# News Story Viz

News Story Viz is a prototype based on the [D3 Narrative Layout](https://github.com/abcnews/d3-layout-narrative) framework which aims to help create storyline visualizations (similar to [xkcd's Movie Narrative Charts](https://xkcd.com/657/)). With this project, we wanted to explore the use of this type of visualizations in the journalistic domain, having as input news stories. The prototype was developed in the context of my Master's thesis, titled "Narrative Visualization of News Stories". You can access a live version of the project [here](https://marianafcosta.github.io/news-story-viz/).
